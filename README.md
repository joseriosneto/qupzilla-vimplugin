# Vim Plugin for QupZilla
How awesome is [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)? This plugin try to port its functionalities to [QupZilla](https://github.com/QupZilla/qupzilla).

# Compiling

The easiest way as the other [plugins](https://github.com/QupZilla/qupzilla-plugins) is to copy the plugin directory to QupZilla's source tree (ie, in qupzilla/src/plugins) and compile the browser.

For building outside QupZilla's tree you need to export the `QUPZILLA_SRCDIR` environment variable with QupZilla's source directory. For instance, if QupZilla was cloned in `~/workspace/` in Linux:

    $ export QUPZILLA_SRCDIR=$HOME/workspace/qupzilla/

Then you can compile running these commands:

    $ qmake
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
